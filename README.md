# Project Overview


# Issues or other things to add
An Issue That I had at first is that It kept telling me moment not found. I fixed this by deleting the package.json and running
npm install again. If I was to add more to this it would probably be a node liri.js help command with teaches the user how to use this
application.

# Getting Started
After Forking, cloning or downloading this you will need to create a .env file which contains the following information with your spotify api credentials: 

# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret


Once that file is created and your keys are entered into the .env file, open your command window and go into the folder. On the command line enter: npm install,
This will install the npm packages required to run this application. Once those packages are added keep in mindit may take some time, then you can use the application.

On the command line type node liri.js then any of the following commands:

* spotify-this-song
* movie-this
* do-what-it-says
* concert-this


After the movie, song or concert commands you can type the name of the movie, song or band name you will not need to capitalize or worry about spacing. Below are a few examples of how your command line could look:

node liri.js spotify-this-song fight song

node liri.js movie-this aliens

node liri.js concert-this drake
